# React Native useRef Hook Async Operation Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications when using the `useRef` hook with asynchronous operations. The error arises when a component unmounts before an asynchronous operation within a `useRef` callback completes.  The callback attempts to update the ref of an unmounted component, which can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the React Native application.
4. Navigate to the component causing the issue.
5. Observe the console logs for errors.

## Solution

The provided solution demonstrates how to properly handle asynchronous operations within `useRef` to prevent the error.  The key is to use the `useEffect` hook's cleanup function to cancel any pending asynchronous operations when the component unmounts.
