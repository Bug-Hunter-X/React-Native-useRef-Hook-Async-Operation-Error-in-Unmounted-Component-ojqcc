This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the asynchronous operation within the `useRef` callback completes.  This leads to a potential memory leak or unexpected behavior because the callback still tries to update the ref even after the component is gone.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('some_url');
      const data = await response.json();
      myRef.current = data; // Potential error here
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
